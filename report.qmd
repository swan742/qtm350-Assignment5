## Introduction
This report analyzes data from the World Bank [@worldbank2022] and used methods described by Wickham and Grolemund [@wickham2016].

## Data Analysis Table

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('wdi.csv')

table_stats = df[['gdp_per_capita', 'life_expectancy', 'unemployment_rate']].describe()
table_stats
```

```markdown
gdp_per_capita is distributed around the mean of 21142.747 with a std of 31040.301. The mean of life_expectancy is about 73.108, and its std is about 7.943. The average unemployment rate is about 7.197 with a std of 5.846.
## Data Visualizations
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-scatter-gdp-life
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy"
#| echo: false
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(df['gdp_per_capita'], df['life_expectancy'], alpha=0.5)
plt.title('GDP vs Life Expectancy (2022)')
plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita (USD)')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy (Years)')
plt.show()

#| label: fig-bars
#| fig-cap: "Top 10 Countries by Total Population (2022)."
#| echo: false

import seaborn as sns

top_10_pop = df.nlargest(10, 'total_population')

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(data=top_10_pop, x='total_population', y='country')
plt.title('Top 10 Countries by Population')
plt.xlabel('Total Population')
plt.ylabel('Country')
plt.show()
```

```markdown
## Conclusion
As illustrated in @fig-scatter-gdp-life, there is a positive trend between 
national wealth and health outcomes. Countries with higher GDP per capita 
generally report higher life expectancy. The absolute value of the slope is decreasing.
The distribution of global population is highly concentrated. In @fig-bars, 
we can see that the top few countries (India and China) have significantly larger populations than the rest of the world.
